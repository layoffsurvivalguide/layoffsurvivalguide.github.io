## The World as a Makeshift Team

The saying, "The world is a giant makeshift team," has resonated across China, encapsulating a sentiment of transient solutions and short-term decision-making that seems to pervade our global society. This phrase paints a picture of a world often improvising, barely stitching together plans that lack depth for future stability—much like a group of strangers temporarily pooling their efforts to patch up a leak, knowing well the fix might not hold.

This perspective often arises from observing how power maneuvers and decisions are crafted. When layoffs roll out, corporate leaders frequently dress these cuts in cloaks of necessity and strategic adjustments, aiming to frame these tough decisions as thoughtful, albeit hard choices. Yet, from a broader lens, these actions often appear as temporary fixes—strategies to safeguard profits or entrenched interests with little regard for the employees or the broader societal impact. It's as if the same hands that welcomed new hires with open arms are now, without skipping a beat, directing them towards the exit.

Though the sting of layoffs reflects rational corporate maneuvers within our current business paradigms and institutional structures, it's a dance we all recognize—no one truly escapes the rhythm of economic survival and competitive edge. Regardless of one’s background or beliefs, stepping into roles of influence often means facing similar pressures, and perhaps, making similar choices.

Yet, this concept of the world as a makeshift assembly calls us to question and reflect on our established systems and values. It challenges the concentration of power, the shortsightedness of decision-making processes, and the overshadowing of profit above all else. However, it also presents us as opportunities for growth and positive evolution. Notably, top tech giants like Meta, Amazon, Microsoft, Google, and Apple cut around 112,000 jobs from their pandemic highs yet they now employ 71% more people than before the crisis and have seen an 81% increase in revenue over the past five years, boosting their market value by $3.5 trillion.

While escaping the entrenched corporate logic might seem impossible, we can choose to remain vigilant, value deeper, more empathetic perspectives, and influence change where possible. By nurturing and promoting these shifts, we may one day foster a world that isn't quite so reliant on makeshift solutions.

## Layoffs Really Suck

When the layoff email hit my inbox, I was swept into a storm of emotions—it was my first layoff, after all. The logical part of me said, "Move on," but my heart was heavy, pulsing with a mix of anger and disbelief. My first move? I updated my LinkedIn status to ‘Open to Work’, and not without a sigh, added that all-too-familiar #OpenToWork frame to my profile picture.

Here’s why it hurt:

- My performance had been solid; no issues there.
- I’d barely settled in, still within my probation period.
- If my role was now redundant, why was it necessary just a few months back?
- My job loss hit hard - my paycheck covered most of our expenses for our young family and mortgage.
- And the job market? Less than welcoming.

The shock was visceral, like a sucker punch to the gut at the worst possible moment. It wasn’t just about losing a job; it was about losing my footing just as I was starting to get comfortable. The initial anger gave way to fear and anxiety. With a family depending on me, wallowing in self-pity wasn’t an option. That’s when the shift began. Talking it out with my partner and a few close friends didn’t just help; it was healing. Being heard and releasing that torrent of initial emotions was oddly freeing. From those ashes of frustration, my old fighting spirit began to flicker back to life. I wasn't going to let this setback define me, but oh, the timing could not have been worse!
